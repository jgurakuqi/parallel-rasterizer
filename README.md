## Requirements

The goal of this project is to implement a parallel 3D software rendering pipeline with programmable fragment shader.

## Installation

In order to run this project a basic C++ compiler with a bash/shell or an IDE is required.
Also, the provided input images are required in a bitmap format (.bmp).

## Usage

To run the projects it's required a suitable IDE or C++ shell compiler.

## Contributing

stb_image.h and stb_image_write.h are a freely available library I decided to import to load easily bitmap files. If a better alternative is available they could be replaced.
Also the multi-threading level could be improved, to achieve even better performance.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jgurakuqi/parallel-rasterizer
```
